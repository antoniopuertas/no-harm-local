      "question": "A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?",
      "response": "The correct next action for the resident to take is **C: Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake**.\n\n### **Reasoning:**\n1. **Medical Ethics and Transparency** \u2013 Full disclosure of complications (even unintended ones) is a cornerstone of patient trust and ethical medical practice. Omitting a tendon injury\u2014even if repaired\u2014could lead to long-term functional issues or legal/ethical consequences.\n\n2. **Legal and Institutional Obligations** \u2013 Operative reports must accurately document all intraoperative events, including complications, regardless of perceived severity. Falsifying records violates medical standards and could have serious professional repercussions.\n\n3. **Resident\u2019s Role in Patient Safety** \u2013 As a trainee, the resident has a duty to uphold ethical principles, even when pressured by a senior physician. This includes advocating for truthful documentation and patient communication.\n\n4. **Why Not the Other Options?**\n   - **A & B** \u2013 While disclosure to the patient is ideal, the resident should not dictate an inaccurate report. The attending\u2019s directive to omit the error is unethical.\n   - **D** \u2013 Reporting to the ethics committee is premature; the resident should first address the issue directly with the attending.\n   - **",

He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The patient\u2019s mother received routine prenatal care and declined first trimester screening. She subsequently underwent a quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation that demonstrated decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A.

      "question": "A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency department for progressively worsening fatigue, malaise, fever, and abdominal pain. He reports that his symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and he has noticed episodes of diarrhea. He recently started melatonin and magnesium supplementation in hopes of improving his sleep. Medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder that required multiple hospital admissions for management of acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis. He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. On hospital day 2, the nurse reports that the patient is oliguric in the setting of constant fluid intake. Physical examination is unchanged. Laboratory testing is significant for a serum sodium of 131 mEq/L and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (it was 0.9 mg/dL on admission). Urine studies are significant for a low urine sodium level, without evidence of blood or protein. Since the hospital admission, he has not been started on any new medications.

      "question": "A 54-year-old woman with a past medical history of mental retardation, hypertension, and diabetes presents to the emergency department with a change in her behavior. Her caretakers state that the patient\u2019s gait suddenly became ataxic, and she became less responsive than her normal non-verbal baseline. Her temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/68 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an unremarkable HEENT exam with normal facial features and no signs of airway compromise. Neurological exam is remarkable for new onset spasticity. The patient has 3+ reflexes and a positive Babinski sign. Musculoskeletal exam is only notable for symmetric swelling and deformities of the patient\u2019s hands bilaterally. Additionally, there is a \"clunk\" when posterior force is applied to the head while anterior force is applied to the cervical spine. Which of the following is the most likely risk factor that predisposed this patient to this condition?",
      "response": "The most likely risk factor that predisposed this patient to her current condition is:\n\n**E: Rheumatoid arthritis**\n\n### **Reasoning:**\n1. **Clinical Presentation:**\n   - The patient has **new-onset spasticity, hyperreflexia (3+ reflexes), and a positive Babinski sign**, suggesting **upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction** (likely due to **spinal cord compression**).\n   - The **\"clunk\" sign** (Lhermitte\u2019s sign) when flexing the neck is **highly suggestive of cervical spinal cord compression** (e.g., from **atlantoaxial subluxation**).\n   - **Symmetric hand swelling and deformities** are classic for **rheumatoid arthritis (RA)**, which commonly affects the hands and can lead to **atlantoaxial instability** due to ligamentous laxity and erosion of the cervical spine.\n\n2. **Key Risk Factor:**\n   - **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)** is strongly associated with **atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS)**, which can compress the spinal cord and cause **UMN signs (spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski), gait ataxia, and Lhermitte\u2019s sign**.\n   - The patient\u2019s **",

She says that the chest pain is worse when she breathes or coughs. Furthermore, on the way to the hospital she noticed that there were specks of blood on a tissue that she coughed into. She has no previous medical history and does not recall anything that could have provoked these symptoms. On presentation her temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 107/65 mmHg, pulse is 102/min, respirations are 21/min, and O2 saturation is 91% on room air. Further testing shows a large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels, and the patient is started on an appropriate treatment intravenously. After drug administration, the effects of the drug are monitored using a standard blood test. Surprisingly, the test results come back within normal parameters.
