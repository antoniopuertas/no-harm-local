      "response": "The correct answer is **A: Impulse through myelinated fibers is slower than non-myelinated fibers**.\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Myelinated vs. Non-myelinated fibers**:\n   Myelinated nerve fibers conduct impulses **faster** than non-myelinated fibers due to **saltatory conduction** (explained below). This is a fundamental principle of neurophysiology.\n\n2. **Saltatory conduction (Option C)**:\n   In myelinated fibers, the action potential \"jumps\" from one **node of Ranvier** (gaps in the myelin sheath) to the next, significantly speeding up conduction. This is why myelinated fibers are faster.\n\n3. **Membrane currents at nodes of Ranvier (Option B)**:\n   The nodes of Ranvier are rich in voltage-gated ion channels, where action potentials are regenerated. This is correct.\n\n4. **Local anesthesia and myelin (Option D)**:\n   Local anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine) block voltage-gated sodium channels, which are concentrated at the nodes of Ranvier. Thus, they are **more effective on myelinated fibers** because the nodes are exposed and vulnerable. However, the statement says anesthesia is \"effective **only** when",

Here\u2019s why each option is true or false:\n\n#### **A: False**\n- **Oncotic pressure (colloid osmotic pressure)** is primarily determined by plasma proteins (e.g., albumin), which are **not filtered** across the glomerular membrane.\n- As fluid is filtered out of the capillaries, the **protein concentration in the remaining plasma increases**, raising oncotic pressure in the **leaving blood** (post-glomerular).\n- Thus, the oncotic pressure of the fluid **leaving the capillaries is higher** than that entering it, not lower.\n- This is the opposite of what this option states.\n\n#### **B: True**\n- Glucose is freely filtered across the glomerular membrane, so its concentration in the **glomerular filtrate** is nearly identical to that in the **plasma/capillaries** (assuming normal blood glucose levels).\n- Reabsorption occurs later in the tubules, but at the capillary level, concentrations are equal.\n\n#### **C:",

      "response": "The correct answer is **C: Antegrade and retrograde**.\n\n### Explanation:\nAxonal transport refers to the movement of molecules, organelles, and other cellular components along the axon of a neuron. This process occurs in **two directions**:\n\n1. **Antegrade transport** (also called *orthograde transport*): Movement **from the cell body (soma) toward the axon terminal/synapse**. This direction is typically mediated by **kinesin motors** and is responsible for delivering essential components like mitochondria, synaptic vesicles, and proteins to the axon terminal.\n\n2. **Retrograde transport**: Movement **from the axon terminal back toward the cell body**. This direction is mediated by **dynein motors** and is involved in recycling materials, signaling (e.g., neurotrophic factors like BDNF), and clearing waste or pathogens (e.g., viruses like rabies or herpes simplex).\n\nBoth directions are critical for neuronal function, maintenance, and communication. Thus, the most accurate answer is **C**, as axonal transport encompasses both mechanisms.\n\n---\n**Why not the others?**\n- **A (Antegrade only)**: Incorrect, as retrograde transport is equally essential.\n- **B (Retrograde only)**: Incorrect, as antegrade transport is",

When **heavy forces** (such as excessive occlusal pressure or trauma) are applied to the PDL, the following physiological responses occur:\n\n1. **Osteoclastic Activity (Bone Resorption):**\n   - Heavy forces can compress the PDL, leading to **increased pressure on the alveolar bone**.\n   - This triggers **osteoclasts** (cells responsible for bone resorption) to break down bone tissue in response to mechanical stress.\n   - The bone around the tooth may resorb to **relieve pressure**, which can lead to **widening of the PDL space** or even **tooth mobility** if the force is excessive.\n\n2. **Why Not the Other Options?**\n   - **A: Hyalinization** \u2013 This occurs when **light to moderate forces** cause necrosis of PDL fibers, leading to a glassy (hyaline) appearance.

      "response": "The correct answer is **A: Collagenase**.\n\n### **Explanation:**\nPeriodontitis is characterized by the destruction of periodontal tissues, including the breakdown of **collagen fibers** in the periodontal ligament and gingival connective tissue. This breakdown is primarily mediated by **bacterial enzymes**, particularly **collagenases** (also called **matrix metalloproteinases, MMPs**), produced by periodontal pathogens such as *Porphyromonas gingivalis*, *Prevotella intermedia*, and *Tannerella forsythia*.\n\n#### **Why not the other options?**\n- **B: Hyaluronidase** \u2013 This enzyme degrades hyaluronic acid (a component of the extracellular matrix), but it is **not the primary cause of collagen fiber breakdown** in periodontitis.\n- **C: Coagulase** \u2013 This enzyme is involved in blood clot formation (e.g., in *Staphylococcus aureus*) and has **no direct role in periodontal tissue destruction**.\n- **D: None of the above** \u2013 Incorrect, as **collagenase** is a well-established bacterial product in periodontal disease pathogenesis.\n\n### **Key Mechanism:**\n- **Collagenases** (e.g., MMP-8, MMP-9) cleave collagen",

This is a classic case for a **comparison of means**.\n\n2. **Group Independence**:\n   The two groups (supplemented vs. non-supplemented) are **independent** (i.e., the same newborn cannot belong to both groups).
